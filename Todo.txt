Here are the things we need to do:

Create Classes
	- Card
	- Deck
	- Gameplay
	- Player

Create a UML Design
	- This will show how our classes interact with each other

EACH MEMBER SHOULD HAVE A GITHUB ACCOUNT

For now I think we sohuld work on the Class Card
	- Break it down into few parts and share the work.
